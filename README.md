Specification Integration Facility - schema, constraints, checker and examples

## Purpose
SpecIF represents the visible, i.e. the diagrams and the text, as well as the semantics of system specifications for model integration and model exchange.

Basic Assumptions:
- There will be always specialized tools for different purposes
- It is unwise to require collaborators to use certain tools or even a single tool
- There is an interest to search, navigate and audit partial results in a common context

Thatâ€˜s where SpecIF kicks in.


For details see http://specif.de.

This branch details schema and constraints at SpecIF level-1. This level is characterized by
- A SpecIF data set (container) must have information elements with unique identifiers. So there is no support for information elements with multiple revisions.
- Information content for one language is supported.
- Lossless transformation to and from ReqIF is possible.
- For SpecIF containers with multiple revisions of the same information element and for multi-language support, please consult the main branch starting version 0.11.x
