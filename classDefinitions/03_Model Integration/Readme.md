SpecIF domain 03-Model Integration
===

The domain 03-Model Integration defines the classes known from the Fundamental Modeling Concepts (FMC) 
which have proven to be effective for integrating partial models from different tools and notations using SpecIF. 
With the FMC approach it is possible to represent different kinds of modeling data 
as used in notations like FMC, UML, SysML etc. 

A complete template for model integration is available [here](./903_Model-Integration-Classes.specif).
