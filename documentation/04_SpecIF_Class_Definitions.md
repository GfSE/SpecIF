# SpecIF Class Definitions

To define the semantic for SpecIF a collection of data type and class definitions are defined and part of the SpecIF standard. 

The class definitions provided as SpecIF data is available here: https://github.com/GfSE/SpecIF/tree/master/classDefinitions

## Domains

The definition of the SpecIF classes is organized in application domains. 
This allows the definition of releases for some domains at the same time where 
other domains are still under discussion and under development and will be released later in time.

For SpecIF 1.0 three domains are part of the first release:

* 01 - Base Definitions
* 02 - Requirements Engineering
* 03 - Model Integration 

### Domain types
The following list shows the currently defined domains and their IDs:

|Domain ID|Domain|Description|Release status|
|---------|-|-|-|
|01|Base definitions|Common definitions relevant for all domains (e.g. primitive data types)|Unreleased|
|02|Requirements Engineering|Classical requirements engineering following the IREB definitions|Unreleased|
|03|Model Integration|SpecIF mapping for the Fundamental Modeling Concepts approach usable to integrate system modeling data|Unreleased|
|04|Automotive Requirements Engineering|Automotive-specific requirements engineering extensions (VDA)|Unreleased|
|05|Agile Requirements Engineering|Requirements engineering for agile development (e.g. epics and user stories)|Unreleased|
|06|UML-SpecIF mapping|Extensions to map UML (Unified Modeling Lanaguage) models to SpecIF|Unreleased|
|07|Issue Management|Issue and Task management|Unreleased|
|08|BOM|Bill of materials|Unreleased|
|09|Variant Management|Feature model-based variant management|Unreleased|
|10|Vocabulary Definition|Resources to define Vocabularies (e.g. SpecIF Vocabulary)|Unreleased|

## Domain 01: Base Definitions

## Domain 02: Requirements Engineering

## Domain 03: Model Integration

## Further domains

The other domains are still under discussion and not yet part of an official SpecIF release. It is planed to release them with a future release.
