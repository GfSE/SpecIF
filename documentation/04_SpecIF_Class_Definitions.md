# SpecIF Class Definitions

To define the semantics for SpecIF a collection of data type and class definitions is defined and is part of the SpecIF standard. 

The class definitions provided as SpecIF data is available here: https://github.com/GfSE/SpecIF/tree/master/classDefinitions

## Domains

The definition of the SpecIF classes is organized in application domains. 
This allows the definition of releases for some domains at the same time, where 
other domains are still under discussion and under development and will be released later in time.

For SpecIF 1.1 three domains are part of the first release:

* 01 - Base Definitions
* 02 - Requirements Engineering
* 03 - Model Integration 

The other domains are still under discussion and not yet part of an official SpecIF release. 
It is planed to release them with a future release.

### Domain types
The following list shows the currently defined domains and their IDs:

|Domain ID|Domain|Description|Release status|
|---------|-|-|-|
|01|Base definitions|Common definitions relevant for all domains (e.g. primitive data types)|Released in 1.1|
|02|Requirements Engineering|Classical requirements engineering following the IREB definitions|Releases in 1.1|
|03|Model Integration|SpecIF mapping for the Fundamental Modeling Concepts approach usable to integrate system modeling data|Releases in 1.1|
|04|Automotive Requirements Engineering|Automotive-specific requirements engineering extensions (VDA)|Unreleased|
|05|Agile Requirements Engineering|Requirements engineering for agile development (e.g. epics and user stories)|Unreleased|
|06|UML/SysML Integration|Deprecated. Covered by domain 03 Model Integration.|Deprecated|
|07|Issue Management|Issue and Task management|Unreleased|
|08|BOM|Bill of materials|Unreleased|
|09|Variant Management|Feature model-based variant management|Unreleased|
|10|Vocabulary Definition|Resources to define Vocabularies (e.g. SpecIF Vocabulary)|Unreleased|
