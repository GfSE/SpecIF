# SpecIF Model Integration Guide for BPMN

## BPMN to SpecIF mapping

For introduction to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), see the [BPMN 2.0 Symbol Reference](https://camunda.com/de/bpmn/bpmn-2-0-symbol-reference/), for example.

Where:
- For all entities in the left column the namespace 'bpmn:' is used
- The original model element type is stored in a property named _dcterms:type_. 

Comments:
1. A participant is also called a 'pool'.
1. A lane is considered a responsible person or role, thus an FMC:Actor.
1. Interestingly enough, in BPMN the name and other information are properties of _dataObjectReference_ resp. _dataStoreReference_ (rather than _dataObject_ or _dataStore_). Also the associations point to the references. Therefore, the references are transformed and the dcterms:type is anyways set to _dataObject_ resp. _dataStore_.
1. A messageFlow between different processes is transformed to a _dataObject_ with _SpecIF:writes_ and _SpecIF:reads statements_ connecting to the sending resp. receiving process steps or events.
1. Currently a _group_ is not represented as a SpecIF model-element, because some (or even all) widely used BPMN modelers do not indicate explicitly in their BPMN-XML export, which activities or other are contained. Thus, the semantics of a group are not easily derived. The geometric coordinates of the diagram can be analyzed to identify contained elements of a group, of course: This is a development task to do.

### Statements

At present, the following statements are derived from BPMN diagrams, where the _statement terms_ (_predicates_) are highlighted in _italics_:

| [BPMN-XML](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN/) |  | [SpecIF](https://specif.de) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Appearance on diagram* | diagram _SpecIF:shows_ model-element | SpecIF:shows |  |
| *Graphical Containment* | process _SpecIF:contains_ lane | SpecIF:contains |  |
| *Graphical Containment* | lane _SpecIF:contains_ activity or event | SpecIF:contains |  |
| dataInputAssociation | activity _SpecIF:reads_ data | SpecIF:reads |  |
| dataOutputAssociation | activity _SpecIF:writes_ data | SpecIF:writes |  |
| sequenceFlow | activity _SpecIF:precedes_ activity | SpecIF:precedes |  |
| sequenceFlow ('outgoing' with respect to the event) | event _SpecIF:precedes_ activity | SpecIF:precedes |  |
| sequenceFlow ('incoming' with respect to the event) | activity _SpecIF:precedes_ event | SpecIF:precedes |  |
| association | annotation _SpecIF:refersTo_ model-element | SpecIF:refersTo |  |

Where:
- For all entities in the left column the namespace 'bpmn:' is used
- 'model-element' is one of [ 'FMC:Actor', 'FMC:State', 'FMC:Event' ]
- 'activity' is one of [ task, manualTask, userTask, scriptTask, serviceTask, sendTask, receiveTask, callActivity, transaction, subProcess ], thus a FMC:Actor
- 'data' is one of [ dataObjectReference, dataStoreReference ], thus a FMC:State
- 'event' is one of [ startEvent, intermediateThrowEvent, intermediateCatchEvent, boundaryEvent, endEvent ], thus a FMC:Event
 
### Example

The following clipping from BPMN-XML represents an event, an activity, a sequenceFlow and a forking exclusive gateway:

The following SpecIF graph expresses the same:
