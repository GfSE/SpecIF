# SpecIF Model-Integration Guide for FMC

## FMC-SpecIF mapping

For introduction to the Fundamental Modelling Concepts (FMC), see the [FMC Overview](http://f-m-c.org/).

### Resources

The mapping of FMC model element types to SpecIF is straight forward, as SpecIF uses the FMC model element types to integrate models of different notations.
Thus, FMC Actors, States and Events are directly mapped to FMC:Actor, FMC:State and FMC:Event respectively.

### Statements

_{ToDo}_

### Example

An explanation in detail is given in a tutorial [Very simple model using FMC](https://github.com/GfSE/SpecIF/blob/master/tutorials/06_Very-Simple-Model-FMC.md).
