# Tutorial 8: 'Requirement with Vocabulary Term'

The previously discussed requirement has a property indicating it's  priority. Here one of enumerated priority values is provided as a vocabulary term.

```json
{
    "dataTypes": [{
      "id": "DT-Priority",
      "title": "SpecIF:Priority",
      "description": "Enumerated values for priority",
      "type": "xs:enumeration",
      "values": [{
        "id": "V-Prio-0",
        "value": "High"
      },{
        "id": "V-Prio-1",
        "value": [{
          "text": "Rather High",
          "language": "en"
        },{
          "text": "Eher hoch",
          "language": "de"
        }]
      },{
        "id": "V-Prio-4",
        "value": "SpecIF:priorityLow"
      }],
      "multiple": false,
      "changedAt": "2020-03-26T22:59:00+02:00"
    }]
}
```

Some explanations:
- The first value with "id":"V-Prio-0" is provided as a string in a single language and the second value with "id":"V-Prio-1" is provided as a list of JSON objects with *text* and *language* attributes (see tutorial [Requirement with Multiple Languages](./07_Requirement-with-Multiple-Languages.md)). 
- The last value with "id":"V-Prio-4" is a vocabulary term consisting of a namespace in front of the colon ':' and the term thereafter.
- Agreed-upon vocabulary terms help both collaborators to communicate more clearly and systems to match data fields automatically. SpecIF adopts terms and their definitions from other initiatives, for example from the [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)](http://dublincore.org/), the [Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC)](http://open-services.net/) and the [International Requirements Engineering Board (IREB)](http://ireb.org/).
- In fact, not only the last enumerated value, but also the *title* is a vocabulary term. Have a look at the currently defined [SpecIF Vocabulary Terms](https://specif.de/apps/view#import=../examples/Vocabulary.specifz). By the way, the vocabulary itself is represented in a SpecIF data-set.

Let us at last have a look at the full example:

When to use values with multiple languages or a vocabulary term? Some aspects are considered, here:
- A vocabulary term is most often preferred, if it exists. It is a clear definition of the concept without limitation to a specific domain or national language. The systems working with SpecIF data-sets must then be prepared to provide suitable translations for the users.
- In case of multiple-language values, the SpecIF data-set carries some language options and thus the systems used do not need to lookup vocabulary terms.
- Try with different language settings of your Web-Browser: In the example given below, the SpecIF Viewer shows the priority value "low", "niedrig" or "bas".

You may also view/download the example [Requirement with Vocabulary Term](http://specif.de/examples/08_Requirement-with-Vocabulary-Term.specif "SpecIF Example \'Requirement with Vocabulary Term\'") or display it using the [SpecIF Viewer](http://specif.de/apps/view#import=../examples/08_Requirement-with-Vocabulary-Term.specif).
